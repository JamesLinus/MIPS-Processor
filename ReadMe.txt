The following files and folders contain MIPS Central Processing Unit.

One project contains the Single Stage processing unit supports the full MIPS instruction set.
The full list of instructions can be viewed at: MIPSSpecificationSheet.html

For the Single Stage project:

To view schematic of control flow: ./MIPS Single Stage/MIPS_Datapath.pdf
To view source code: ./MIPS Single Stage/design/

The other project contains a Five Stage processing unit, by adding intermediate registers the processor increases throughput.
