The MIPS processor was designed in 1984 by researchers at Stanford University. MIPS is a RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processor. Compared to a CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) counterparts (such as the Intel Pentium processors), RISC processors typically support fewer and much simpler instructions.

The premise is, however, that a RISC processor can be made much faster than a CISC processor because of its simpler design. These days, it is generally accepted that RISC processors are more efficient than CISC processors; and even the only popular CISC processor that is still around (Intel Pentium) internally translates the CISC instructions into RISC instructions before they are executed.

In this project David Pynes and Andrew Sperry developed a single stage and a five stage MIPS processor.
